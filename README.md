# SQL-project

In this project we generated new data for a company that lists various details about the employees. We sketched out an ERD for tables, designed the tables to hold data in CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and used those in order to formulate our findings with the data.

First we began with the sketch of ERD for creation of tables

Our next step was to create tables into a database and export these as csv files

once we created tables into our database, and we populated these tables. We queried the data in order to get answer for details such as name of employees, sex, age, and salary
